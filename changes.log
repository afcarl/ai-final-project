4/5: Worked on extracting opinion keywords & building a sentiment classifier. 
Used a naive bayes classifier on a pre-classified set of movie reviews. 
Used the trained classifier to figure out which words were opinion keywords.

Original feature set: the n most common words in the entire review.
Stopwords and punctuation were removed, and all words were made lowercase.
For each interview, each feature was marked as binary (1 if present in review, 0 if not).

Number of features used: 1000
Ratio of train set size to test set size: 0.75 to 0.25
Accuracy of bayes classifier: 0.786
