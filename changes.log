4/5: Worked on extracting opinion keywords & building a sentiment classifier. 
Used a naive bayes classifier on a pre-classified set of movie reviews. 
Used the trained classifier to figure out which words were opinion keywords.

Original feature set: the n most common words in the entire review.
Stopwords and punctuation were removed, and all words were made lowercase.
For each interview, each feature was marked as binary (1 if present in review, 0 if not).

Number of features used: 1000
Ratio of train set size to test set size: 0.75 to 0.25
Accuracy of Bayes classifier: 0.786



4/8: Continued working on extracting opinion keywords

Failed experiments:
- Using only adjectives: we realized that there could be important keywords such as 'oscar' or 'masterpiece' that express strong opinion

- Making the top occurring synsets the set of features - not the top occuring words

Same parameters as above
Accuracy of Bayes classifier: 0.766

Successful experiments
- Adding synonyms of most common words to the feature set: this worked and increased the accuracy by 2 points

Same parameters as above
Accuracy of Bayes classifier: 0.805Accuracy of bayes classifier: 0.786

4/8: Added simple feature keywords. TODO: possibly add proper nounds, eg directors' names
